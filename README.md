### This is the repository that accompanies the publication: 
#### A haplotype-resolved chromosomal reference genome for the porcini mushroom Boletus edulis (will add doi of preprint soon)

This is a snakemake pipeline for all analysis, with software packaged in containers with conda/mamba for reproducibility.

#### to run the pipeline, you need the following:
- [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io)
- a cluster system like [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)
- [singularity/apptainer](https://apptainer.org/documentation/)/Docker


The reference genome assembly and newly generated short reads can be found at PRJNA1187522 (available at publication)

#### The entire pipeline looks like this:
